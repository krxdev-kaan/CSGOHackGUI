# CSGOHackGUI

CSGOHackGUI is the IOS Client made for [AqHax-CSGO](https://github.com/krxdev-kaan/AqHax-CSGO/).

## How to use it ?
It's pretty straight forward actually. Just compile and install the app on your phone.
Launch [AqHax-CSGO](https://github.com/krxdev-kaan/AqHax-CSGO/) on your computer and enter the IP that you got from AqHax-CSGO and you should be good to go.

### Supported Devices
- Can be launched on iPhone 5S or any newer device.
- Optimized and tested on iPhone 7 Plus or any newer device.

## Why did it take so long ?

I discontinued the AqHax-CSGO project because i became uninterested over time in such project but i became interested again and i'm making my way back to CSGO Hacking once again.

## Notes

- Please use .xcworkspace instead since there is usage for Pods.

# Credits

- Thanks to my friend @brtrsln for his great icon for the app :)
